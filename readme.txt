Compatible: WordPress 2.0

BlackWater Album Manager is a WordPress plugin developed by
David Mabe (Canoeingkidd). Also, thanks to Owen Winkler for his
buttonsnap class library. This is a PRE-ALPHA release and does not
necessarily reflect the final product. I still have features to add
such as a way to attach and include pictures and albums into posts.
I am sure there are also plenty of bugs. Use at your own risk!

Place the files in a "blackwater" folder in wp-content/plugins. Next,
navigate you the "Plugins" section of your WordPress admin panel and
activate "BlackWater Album Manager." There should now be two admin
pages for "BlackWater" in your WordPress admin panel: one under
"Options" and one under "Manage."
